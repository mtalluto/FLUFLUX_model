\section*{Introduction}

- Blah blah metaecosystems, explicit modelling, rivers

- Paragraph 2

- Paragraph 3

Much work connecting diversity with ecosystem functioning is conducted at the scale of local ecosystems.
Meta-ecosystems in general, and in particular \acp{fme}, however, connect multiple ecosystems across much larger scales (e.g., an entire fluvial network).
Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are likely quite scale dependent \autocite{Gonzalez2020}, and thus models that integrate the relevant processes from local to meta-ecosystem scales are needed to better understand both local and regional dynamics.

Here, we develop a model for \acp{fme} that incorporates the movement and distribution of non-biological material as well as the distribution of species in a biological community.
We construct this model by coupling two commonly-used model types in fluvial ecosystem and community ecology: reaction-transport models (for the non-biological component), and meta-community models (for species).
By linking these two models, we allow for feedbacks between the biological community and resources.
These feedbacks are essential to enable a more mechanistic understanding of the connections between the processes underlying community assembly, resulting biodiversity patterns, and ecosystem function.

\subsection*{Model Description}

Our conceptual starting point for modelling the biological community is metapopulation theory \cite{Levins1969}.
The classic metapopulation model tracks the number of occupied patches $p$ in a landscape composed of $h$ available patches as a function of the rates of colonisation and extinction of local populations within those patches:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{dp}{dt} = cp \left( h - p \right) - pm \label{eq:levins}
\end{equation}

Occupied patches ($p$) experience extinction according to the extinction rate $m$, while unoccupied patches ($h-p$) are colonised according to the colonisation rate $c$. 
The additional $p$ in the colonisation term takes dispersal into account; as more patches are occupied in the metapopulation as a whole, unoccupied patches are colonised more quickly due to increased dispersal from the occupied patches.

\textcite{Hunt2009} extended this model to multi-species communities by adding competition to the extinction term:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial t} = c_i p_i \left( h-p_i \right) - p_i \left( \sum_{j \in S \setminus \left\{i \right\} }{m_{ij}p_j} + m_i \right) \label{eq:hunt}
\end{equation}

where the subscript $i$ indicates a focal species, the subscript $j$ a competitor, and $S \setminus \left\{i \right\}$ is the set of species in the local community excluding the focal species $i$.
Here, the extinction rate is now broken into two terms.
The first a species-specific intrinsic extinction rate $m_i$, representing, e.g., stochastic extinctions that are unrelated to other species in the local community.
The $m_{ij}$ term is the effect of competition between $i$ and $j$ on the extinction rate of $i$ (multiplied by $p_j$ because competition only occurs when species $j$ is also present).
For future clarity of notation, we assume all parameters are specific to a target species $i$ and thus omit the subscript.

In order to produce a useful model where the meta-community interacts with the environment, it is necessary to further extend this model to incorporate local (and potentially dynamic) non-biological conditions in specific patches.
More recent theoretical \autocite{Holt2000,Holt2005} and empirical \autocite{Talluto2017} work has extended the single-species Levins model (eqn. \ref{eq:levins}) by fitting the colonisation and extinction rates as functions of local climatic conditions.
The result is a dynamic range model with long-term occupancy driven by the balance of local colonisation and extinction \autocite{Talluto2017}.
We combine this approach with the multi-species Hunt model (\ref{eq:hunt}) by redefining the $c$ and $m$ terms to be functions of the quality $q_x$ of a focal patch $x$:

\begin{align}
	c_{x} &= f(q_{x}) \label{eq:talluto} \\
	m_{x} &= g(q_{x})
\end{align}

The shapes of these two functions is flexible; \textcite{Talluto2017} defined them as quadratic functions of local climate conditions.
Our more general approach here can incorporate climatic conditions, local habitat, and dynamical resource concentrations into the $q$ term.
We explore these possibilities further in the case studies.
For now, we consider the case where $q_x = R_x$, the concentration of an essential resource.
We can use a simple reaction-transport model (cite) to describe the fluctuations of this resource concentration in time (the subscript $x$ has been omitted for clarity).

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = \sum_{i \in S}{\rho_i(R)} -\frac{QR - \sum Q_u R_u}{A l} 
	\label{eq:rxn_transport}
\end{equation}

The right-hand term here gives loss due to advective transport, where $Q$ is the discharge of the focal patch (in volumetric units per unit time; we use $m^3 s^{-1}$ throughout), $Q_u$ and $R_u$ are discharge and resource concentrations of upstream patches (including lateral input, if relevant), $A$ is the cross-sectional area ($m^2$), and $l$ is the stream length of the patch ($m$).
The left-hand term is the reaction component.
We consider here only reaction due to biological activity, and postulate that the net reactive change in a patch is the sum of the set of resource use functions, $\rho_i(R)$, of all species $S$ in the local community.
