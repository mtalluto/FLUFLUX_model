## Objectives

Across an entire river network:

* Describe change of resource (POM, DOM, N, P, DO, etc.) concentrations in time (reaction-transport model)
* Describe change of community composition in time (metacommunity model)
* Link these two models via **resource processing** and **habitat filtering**
* Use the resulting model to ask questions in hypothetical river networks:
   - What processes dominate community organisation?
   - How will changes in land use/network structure affect communities/resources?
   - How is diversity related to functioning at local and network scales?
   - etc, etc...

## OLD

**START HERE**
**simplify, streamline, harmonize terminology, add picture/diagram**
**use igraph and flume examples already to draw a network of sites**

$$ \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = cp \left( h-p \right) - pm$$

This model is non-spatial, assumes infinite dispersal, and all patches are identical in quality.

- $p$: number of occupied patches
- $c$: colonisation rate
- $h$: number of available patches
- $m$: extinction rate





## A simple (single-species) metapopulation model

$$ \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = cp \left( h-p \right) - pm$$

This model is non-spatial, assumes infinite dispersal, and all patches are identical in quality.

- $cp$: colonisation depends on prevalence; more occupancy means more propagules, faster colonisation
- $h-p$: only unoccupied patches can be colonised
- $pm$: only occupied patches can experience extinction




## Extending to metacommunities

- For species $i$ competing with a second species $j$

$$ \frac{\partial p_i}{\partial t} = c_i p_i \left( h-p_i \right) - p_i \left( m_{ij}p_j + m_i \right)$$

- Colonisation hasn't changed and is unaffected by competition
- The extinction rate $m$ now has two components

<p class="bullet2">Competitive exclusion in patches where they co-occur: $m_{ij}p_j$</p>
<p class="bullet2">Stochastic extinctions that add to extinction everywhere $i$ occurs: $m_i$</p>

## Extending to metacommunities

For $S$ species in a metacommunity <br/>
(and where $S \setminus \left\{i \right\}$ is the set of species excluding $i$):

$$ \frac{\partial p_i}{\partial t} = c_i p_i \left( h-p_i \right) - p_i \left( \sum_{j \in S \setminus \left\{i \right\} }{m_{ij}p_j} + m_i \right)$$


## Incorporating patch quality

- Goal: include patch quality in a way that allows for feedbacks with reaction-transport model


## Incorporating patch quality

- Goal: include patch quality in a way that allows for feedbacks with reaction-transport model
- For a patch $x$ with habitat quality $q$:

\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial p_{ix}}{\partial t} &= c_{ix} p_{ix} \left( h-p_{ix} \right) - p_{ix} \left( \sum_{j \in S \setminus \left\{i \right\} }{m_{ijx}p_{jx}} + m_{ix} \right) \\
	c_{ix} &= f(q_{ix}) \\
	m_{ix} &= g(q_{ix})
\end{align}

- This model is now spatially explicit and incorporates different niches for each species
- Note that in pratice, it doesn't make sense to talk about a rate for a specific patch, so we convert to probabilities of colonisation/extinction

## Incorporating patch quality

\begin{align}
	c_{ix} &= f(q_{ix}) \\
	m_{ix} &= g(q_{ix})
\end{align}

- $c$ and $m$ functions are flexible

For example, we used them to link C-E dynamics to climate:

## Adding Feedbacks

## Adding Feedbacks

- Starting with a reaction transport model with state variable $R$ (a resource)
- Include a **resource use function**, $\rho_i(R)$, which is the effect of species $i$ on the resource

\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} &= \sum_{i \in S}{\rho_i(R)} -\frac{QR - Q_u R_u}{A dx}
\end{align}

-Two questions remain:

<p class="bullet2">How to define the strength of competition $m_{ix}$?</p>
<p class="bullet2">How to connect patch quality $q$ with resources $R$?</p>




## Patch Quality

Imagine that $R$ represents, instead of a point value, a *distribution* of resources in a patch

```{r fig.align = "center"}
suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2))
suppressWarnings(library(data.table))
suppressWarnings(library(RColorBrewer))

xl <- -9
xu <- 9

x <- seq(xl, xu, length.out=1000)

# set up colors
lpal <- c(brewer.pal(6, "Blues")[4:6], "#cb181d", "#6A2444", "#4d004b")
fpal <- paste0(lpal, "77")
fpal2 <- paste0(lpal, c(rep('22', 4), '77', '77'))
names(lpal) <- names(fpal) <- names(fpal2) <- c(paste0("s", 1:3), 'r', 's2_r', 's1_r')


fs1 <- function(x) dnorm(x, -2, 2)
fs2 <- function(x) dnorm(x, 0, 2)
fs3 <- function(x) dnorm(x, 2, 2)
fr <- function(x) dnorm(x, 2, 2)

## point where sp2 and resources cross
xpt_r_sp2 <- uniroot(function(x) fs2(x) - fr(x), c(xl, xu))$root

dat <- data.table(x = x)
dat[,c("s1", "s2", "s3", "r") := .(fs1(x), fs2(x), fs3(x), fr(x))]

pl0 <- ggplot(dat) + theme_minimal() + 
	scale_y_continuous(name="Density/Fitness", limits = c(0, max(dat$s1,dat$s2, dat$s3))) + 
	scale_x_continuous(name="Resource Value", limits = c(xl, xu)) + 
	theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank(), 
		axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank())

pl_r <- pl0 + geom_polygon(aes(x=x, y=r), color=lpal["r"], fill=fpal["r"]) 
pl_r

```


## Patch Quality

Similarly, a species' niche can be characterized by a gaussian fitness function $\omega_i(R)$, showing how well it does under certain resource regimes

```{r fig.align = "center"}

pl_sp2 <- pl0 + geom_polygon(aes(x=x, y=s2), color=lpal["s2"], fill=fpal["s2"]) 
pl_sp2
```



## Patch Quality

Patch quality $q_{ix}$ then is the overlap between the resource distribution $R_x$ and the fitness function $\omega_i(R)$


```{r fig.align = "center"}
## note, this is easy to compute. If both are probability distributions with PDF f(x) and g(x) and CDFs F(x) and G(x), and they cross at x = c
## then the overlap area is just 1 - F(c) + G(c), assuming F(x) is the left curve

pl_s2_r <- pl_r + geom_polygon(aes(x=x, y=s2), color=lpal["s2"], fill=fpal["s2"])
pl_s2_r
```


## Patch Quality

Patch quality $q_{ix}$ then is the overlap between the resource distribution $R_x$ and the fitness function $\omega_i(R)$


```{r fig.align = "center"}
dat.overlap <- data.table(x = x)
dat.overlap[,y := fr(x)]
dat.overlap[x >= xpt_r_sp2, y := fs2(x)]
pl_s2_r_ol <- pl0 + geom_polygon(aes(x=x, y=r), color=lpal["r"], fill=fpal2["r"]) + geom_polygon(aes(x=x, y=s2), color=lpal["s2"], fill=fpal2["s2"]) + 
	geom_polygon(dat = dat.overlap, aes(x=x, y=y), color=lpal["s2_r"], fill=fpal["s2_r"]) 
pl_s2_r_ol
```





## Competition

- The strength of competition is similar

## Competition

- The strength of competition is similar
- For species $i$ and $j$ with fitness functions $\omega_i(R)$ and $\omega_j(R)$, the overlap between the functions is competition strength $m_{ij}$

```{r fig.align = "center"}

pl_sp1_sp2 <- pl0 + geom_polygon(aes(x=x, y=s1), color=lpal["s1"], fill=fpal["s1"]) + geom_polygon(aes(x=x, y=s2), color=lpal["s2"], fill=fpal["s2"]) 
pl_sp1_sp2
```



## Dispersal
<!-- note here; one possibility is to use quality q_ix as a proxy for how much the species uses -->
<!-- then change the mean of the resources by some amount, proportional to the overlap -->
<!-- thus species that are in good quality patches will have a bigger effect (they are more abundant) -->
<!-- \mu_new = \mu_old + q_ix * \alpha -->
<!-- where alpha is the maximal effect of the species on the resource -->
<!-- This might also be something to go to the literature on, or ask Ruben/Gabriel  -->

- The metapopulation model has the colonisation term $c_{ix}p_{ix}$
- The $p$ term represents dispersal
- To better represent dispersal in streams we can add active ($\alpha$) and passive ($\beta$) dispersal

$$ p_{ix}\left(\alpha_i + \sum{Q_y\beta_i}\right)$$


## To-do


### Revise \& finalise model
<p class="bullet2">How does a species affect resources in a patch? Need to choose the resource use function  $\rho_i(R)$</p>

### Decide on starting conditions
### Decide on scenarios and hypotheses
